          <h1><strong>WHAT IS A MINDSET ?</strong></h1>
          <h3>
            Mindsets are beliefs about yourself and your basic qualities. Think about your talents, beliefs and intelligence. Do you think these qualities are fixed or do you think that you could
            change these things if you wanted to?

          <h3>1. FIXED MINDSET</h3>
          <h3 style="padding: 10px;">
            A fixed mindset reflects a belief in natural talent: that qualities such as intelligence, creativity, and talent are predetermined and finite. These qualities are so set that whatever you
            lack, you will continue to lack.

          <h3>2. GROWTH MINDSET</h3>
          <h3 style="padding: 10px;">
            A growth mindset is a belief that basic abilities can continue to be developed through hardwork and dedication. These innate qualities are just starting points with success being the fruit
            of effort, learning, and persistence. It involves the ability to accept change and grow with it.
